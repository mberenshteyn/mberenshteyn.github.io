					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Hi! My name is Maxime, and I'm a junior at UC Berkeley, studying computer science and minoring in city planning. I'm a member of the Runtime team at <a href="https://pioneers.berkeley.edu/">Pioneers in Engineering</a>, an organization that develops and runs robotics competitions for high school students around the Bay Area. Previously, I also worked with the Vision Group at the <a href="http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/">International Computer Science Institute</a>.</p>
